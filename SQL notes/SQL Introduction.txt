SQL is abbreviation for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language designed to access, modify, manage or delete data stored in relational database. SQL operates through simple, declarative, statements. 
```
 SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

Relational database
A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.

Insert
The INSERT statement inserts a new row into a table.
```
INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age) 
VALUES (1, 'Justin Bieber', 22);
```

Alter
The ALTER TABLE statement adds a new column to a table.
```
 ALTER TABLE celebs
  ADD COLUMN twitter_handle TEXT;
  SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

Update
The UPDATE statement edits a row in a table.
```
 UPDATE celebs
 SET twitter_handle = '@taylorswift13'
 WHERE id = 4;
 SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

Delete
The DELETE FROM statement deletes one or more rows from a table.
```
 DELETE FROM celebs
 WHERE twitter_handle IS NULL;
 SELECT * FROM celebs;
```

Constraints
Constraints that add information about how a column can be used are invoked after specifying the data type for a column. They can be used to tell the database to reject inserted data that does not adhere to a certain restriction
1. PRIMARY KEY columns can be used to uniquely identify the row. Attempts to insert a row with an identical value to a row already in the table will result in a constraint violation which will not allow you to insert the new row.
2. UNIQUE columns have a different value for every row. This is similar to PRIMARY KEY except a table can have many different UNIQUE columns.
3. NOT NULL columns must have a value. Attempts to insert a row without a value for a NOT NULL column will result in a constraint violation and the new row will not be inserted.
4. DEFAULT columns take an additional argument that will be the assumed value for an inserted row if the new row does not specify a value for that column.
```
 CREATE TABLE awards ( 
   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
   recipient TEXT NOT NULL, 
   award_name TEXT DEFAULT 'Grammy' 
 );
```

SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases.
- A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
- A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.

A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.

- CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
- INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
- SELECT queries data from a table.
- ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
- UPDATE edits a row in a table.
- DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.
Constraints add information about how a column can be used.
